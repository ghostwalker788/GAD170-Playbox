 // When we declare a class and we use the ':' character followed by another class name
 // this means that we are inheriting from that class. This means that any and all variables,
 // methods etc are automatically given to our class of BallResetCheckListItem.
 
public class BallResetCheckListItem : CheckListItem
{
    // If you look at the CheckListItem script, you will see most of the functions and variables
    // are 'virtual', when we use the virtual keyword it means that we can override what that function, or
    // variable does, we do this with the 'override' keyword. 

    // A bool to check if we have already dropped the ball over the edge.
    public bool hasDroppedBall = false; 
    // This is an example of a get and set function, we can use get and sets to do specific code, when we want to get or set a variable.
    // Get is when we want to get the value of IsComplete i.e. mybool = IsComplete; 
    // Set is when we want to change the value of IsComplete i.e.IsComplete = myBool;
    // An example of this would be lets say I want to set a score int and then update the ui.
    // Instead of having multiple functions I could do the following:
    // public int score = 0;
    // public int MyScore{ get {return score;} set {score = value; UIManager.UpdateScore(score);}
    // I would the call MyScore = some new value (i.e. 1); when this happens the score gets set to 1, and the ui automatically updates as it calls the UIManager.UpdateScore.
    // In this example below we are overriding the function IsComplete that is in the CheckListItem class to do something else in this case,
    // we are returning the bool hasDroppedBall.
    public override bool IsComplete { get { return hasDroppedBall; } }

    // This function again is returning a float of our progress of this task,

        // here we are checking if our bool of hasDroppedball is true, we do this by using the '?' character as the start of our if.
        // if it is then we are returning 1, ':' in this scenario is the start of our else statement.
        // instead of writing the following we can do it in 1 line, this one line is the same as:
        // if(hasDroppedBall == true)
        // {
        //      return 1;
        // }
        // else
